                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">1. Online Community</h2>
                            <p class="card-text"><a href="https://hub.e-nable.org/dashboard">e-NABLE Hub </a> is an online community of 3D-printed hands and arms for prosthesis devices. The website has a forum to help each other, a chapter to collaborate with nearby volunteers, and resources to aid volunteers in creating the perfect device at every step of their journey.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">In a similar manner, there is NIH's (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) 3D e-NABLE collection. This website contains a lot of assistive technology designs that are freely available. The collection has many 3D files of prosthesis devices for different needs based on one's physical characteristics.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">For this project, e-NABLE Phoenix Hand v3 will be used. This latest version was created by remixing two previously famous devices: Phoenix Hand v2 and Unlimited Phoenix Hand. This device is available from both websites: <a href="https://hub.e-nable.org/p/devices?p=e-NABLE+Phoenix+Hand+v3">e-NABLE Hub</a> and <a href="https://3d.nih.gov/entries/20260/1.01">NIH</a>. Both websites contain almost identical information. They provide links to the 3D files, instruction manual, video tutorials, and assembly kit for purchase. However, the first website contains a little more information and an updated 3D file. Firstly, the e-NABLE Hub provides information about the device's maturity, cost, popularity, difficulty, and grip strength. For all five categories, e-NABLE Phoenix Hand v3 received the best rating, signaling that this prosthesis device is highly mature, costs little, is popular, is easy to assemble, and has a strong grip. Secondly, e-NABLE Hub has updated the 3D file to make the assembly process a bit easier. The six different pins required for the assembly can be hard to differentiate due to their similarity. Hence, e-NABLE Hub has added a label from A to F so that the volunteer would not accidentally use the wrong pin. Overall, both websites provide similar information and resources for e-NABLE Phoenix Hand v3, but e-NABLE Hub goes further and provides a polished version of the device.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">I have also explored other devices on their websites and other 3D repository site. On NIH collection, some of the unique prosthesis devices include bike handle adapter <https://3d.nih.gov/entries/3DPX-020291> and viola bow holder <https://3d.nih.gov/entries/3DPX-001017>. On a 3D repository site Thingiverse, some of the unique prosthesis devices include an adapter to hold the tool, a remixed version of e-NABLE Phoenix Hand v2 as a Superman theme, and an adapter to hold a pencil. Clearly, there are many open-source prosthesis devices for different needs available online.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">2. Video Tutorial vs Written Instruction</h2>
                                <p class="card-text">For this project, my partner and I decided to assemble the widely respected e-NABLE Phoenix Hand v3. To help us assemble, we reviewed two assembly manuals: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXoVSTgzyec&ab_channel=3DUniverse">a YouTube video tutorial from 3D Universe</a> and <a href="https://enablingthefuture.org/phoenix-hand">a written instruction from Enabling the Future</a>. The video tutorial walks through each step of the journey. In this 36-minute long video, the host assembles the device from the start to the end while describing her action and providing some tips and warnings. The written instruction provides step-by-step instructions on the assembly process for the second version of the prosthesis hand. In this 44-page manual, there are paragraphs of instruction on each page with some 3D visual rendering of each process. Overall, both manuals are detailed and provide good information, but there are some differences between them, and there are some areas of improvement.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Foremost, both manuals are detailed and helpful. They both include visual elements and some sort of language. The video shows the host going through the steps, while the written instruction includes a 3D visual rendering of each process. And, in the video, the host talks through the step, while in the written instruction, the steps are written down in paragraphs.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">However, there are differences in how each manual approaches the assembly process and the content of each manual.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Firstly, in the written instruction, different color was used for each of the different components so that each component could be distinguished from the other. However, in the video, all the components of the 3D printed parts were in one color: brown. Hence, I found it difficult to distinguish each of the components in the video, so if I could change the video, I would print each of the components in a different color, similar to how the written manual has approached this. Therefore, the video can improve the visual aspect of their delivery.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Secondly, in the video, the host frequently tested out the device to ensure that the build was coming in good shape. For example, the host tried out both dental bands and examined which band fit better before making a commitment. However, in the written instruction, there was no mention of taking a pause and checking if the assembly was taking place well. The written instruction could have done a better job documenting a build step by asking the volunteers to test out if the build was assembled correctly. The instruction should explain how the hand should look like and what it should be able to do and should not be able to do if the assembly is done correctly. For instance, similar to the step taken in the video, the written manual should ask the volunteers to try out both dental bands and explain that they should pick a dental band that allows the finger to be folded completely without having to apply too much force. Hence, the written instruction can be improved by being more descriptive about the device rather than merely going through all the steps.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The other few differences between the video tutorial and the written instruction are minor. For instance, in the written instruction, the index and middle fingers were attached to the hand before attaching the ring and pinky fingers, and the instruction contained a link to purchase the assembly kit. These minor differences are not significant and did not impact the build process.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">One of the most confusing aspects of those instructions is the mechanics of the strings. Initially, I was not sure how the strings all worked together. When I was watching the video and reading the instructions, I was confused as to why there are only three strings and not five strings. And, there are lots of holes that the string need to go through, and it was confusing to keep track of all of the holes. These confusions can be addressed by giving the audience an overview of the mechanics of the strings and a detailed diagram of where all the holes the three strings need to go through.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Taking a step back, the video tutorials and the written instructions are good, but I think I could create a better video tutorial and better written instruction. Besides the points mentioned above, they can be better by being more concise. I think 36 minutes is too long to watch, and 44 pages are too long to read. The video should be under 10 minutes, and the written instructions should contain less than 500 words. For the video, I would use animation to better visualize the moving components and use visual elements, such as arrows and circles, to highlight some important areas. I would make the video scripted so that it is easier to understand. For the written instruction, I would put as few words as possible, like a wordless Lego instruction, by using visual elements, such as arrows and before and after pictures. I would only write long sentences when needed, such as writing a warning to put a pin through the index finger and middle finger at the same time. By taking these steps, the video tutorial and the written instruction can be more accessible to a broader audience, such as to the younger audience and non-English-speaking audience. Lastly, the video tutorial and the written instructions did not give a good overview of this build, and there was a lack of context. I was a bit confused about this build, because they did not give a good context around it, and I was not sure what the problem it was trying to solve and how it was trying to address it, so I would include them in my version.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">For this project, my partner and I chose e-NABLE Phoenix Hand v3 as the prosthesis device to assemble. The 3D file (STL) was downloaded from the NIH website for free, and it took multiple prints to successfully print all the parts. Initially, I tried to use a Raise E2 3D printer. I modified the scale of the components by 150%, because the professors recommended us to print a bigger hand as it is easier to assemble. I was initially confused as to why this was the case, but when I think about it, this is similar to how big Lego bricks for toddlers are easier to assemble than normal-sized Lego bricks. After increasing the scale, I laid out the pieces on Raise's proprietary CAM software IdeaMaker. It took some time to lay all the pieces in the limited space, because there were a lot of components to print, the size of the printable area was not big, and I wanted to print all the components in one session. However, I soon found out that there was an issue with the nozzle, and without a mechanical fix, the printer would not function. So, I used Ender and Cura to print them. There were some hiccups along the way, such as the filament ran out midway, the print lifted away from the bed, some layers did not stick well, and the scale was not increased. Gladly, most of the issues were fixed by reprinting them.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Due to the scheduling and timing issues, my partner and I used a pre-printed piece to assemble the hand. Along with the 3D printed parts, we used an assembly kit purchased for this prosthetic device, and a scissor and a screwdriver were the necessary tools needed to assemble it. For the guidance, we mainly used the written instructions to assemble it, but since the instruction was written for the previous version, we relied on the video for some parts, such as attaching the string. The overall assembly was smooth, but there were some incidents. Firstly, we made a mistake when attaching the pin for the middle and index fingers. We attached the pin after lining up the index finger without also lining up the middle finger. This was a problem because the middle finger cannot be attached to the hand. To pull the pin out, we had to use some sharp objects to forcibly push it out. Secondly, we were not sure how to tie the string at both ends. We wanted it to be sturdy, yet we did not know the best way to tie a single string rope, as we mainly have experience tying two strings together. Regardless, we tried our best and made multiple nodes to ensure that it would withstand great tension. Thirdly, we were confused about how the strings work and their role. We knew that the strings were meant to squeeze the hand but were not sure how it exactly worked. So, we looked at the video carefully and our classmate's finished product for reference. This helped us get a better sense of the idea of how the string should be attached and incorporated into the hand. Lastly, we struggled the most with calibrating the string to optimize the grip. The grip was loss, because we did not follow the instructions carefully and tie the string when the hand is folded at 30°. So, we had to untie the string and adjust the three metal screws. Some strings were tied so tightly that we cut them off and attached a new string. Overall, although it took more than two hours to assemble it, it was fairly smooth as any obstacles were overcome relatively quickly and simply.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">If I ever needed a prosthetic hand, I would want a customized version of a hand that is tailored to sculpturing, one of my favorite activities. For this art activity, several tools are needed: wire-end modeling, smooth modeling, carving, and detailing. These tools will be on each of the fingertips. Assuming that each hand can be controlled individually, such a prosthetic device can be beneficial when sculpturing because all the tools will be on their fingertip rather than having to drop off the tool, find the new one, and pick it up. This can save time. Also, having it on the fingertip could give greater control because it is built on the device and is sturdier and stable.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Soon, the print was completed. Sadly, it was still loose. We carefully examined the fit and realized that one of the sides of the circuit board was not smooth and flat. At the top left corner of the board, there is a little dent that was causing the distance between the board and enclosure to be different across the edges. So, we decided to remove the dent by using the scraper with rough surfaces to sand it off.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Unfortunately, due to a guest demonstration, we were not able to work much in the classroom and had to meet up later that day to continue with the process.</p>

So, my partner went on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23853/makes">Thingiverse.com to find the perfect enclosure</a> , which he chose to be an igloo. He imported it into Fusion 360, and we created a shared group project in Fusion 360 with the help of TA. With my help, he learned how to turn the mesh into a body. Since the igloo has a lot of mesh, we had to wait for his computer to convert it into a body.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">11. Rethinking the Approach to Measurement</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">After some contemplation, I realized that there may be a flaw in the measurement method. For example, it may not have been the best to measure the distance between each electrical component. For the screen, we measured the distance between the edge of the board and the start of the screen, the distance between the start and the end of the screen, the end of the screen and the start of the next screen, and so on. When the individual measurement of the screen was added up, it did not add up to the actual width of the board. It is 0.50mm or 0.51% bigger.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">To address this issue, I remeasured all the dimensions by measuring the relative distance to a certain point of the circuit board, mainly the top left corner. So, when I would measure the location of the start of the second screen, I would measure the distance between the top left corner of the clock and the start of the second screen rather than adding up the measurements. A total of 59 measurements were done and entered as a parameter.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">I noticed that there are differences in the measurement between mine and the one taken with my partner. Finding all the differences would be simple, as we have measure different thing and to compare the distance between two points, I would have to do some more computation. Nevertheless, the most obvious differences are the width and the length of the circuit board. It was previously measured as 97.49mm by 48.92mm, but I found it to be 97.46mm by 48.90, which is 2mm to 3mm difference in measurement. This is a minor difference, but one of the most visible differences was the vertical distance between the edge of the board and the start of the screen. It was previously measured as 4.26mm, but I found it to be 3.5mm, which is 18% smaller. It seems that no two measurements between the previous one and the new one are the same, due to the nature of the caliper. The caliper measures the distance in 0.01mm increments, which is very small. And, it is also not easy to control the caliper, especially when external jaws – a tool used to measure the outer dimension of an object – are not used. Due to the smallness of the electrical components, we had to rely a lot on the depth measuring blade – a tool used to measure the depth of an object relative to the surface – and it was the hardest tool to control, because adjusting the force that we apply to slider the caliper is challenging and it is hard to make an adjustment in 0.01mm increment due to the friction between the slides.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Spending a few hours, I created a face and a simple rectangular enclosure with one fully constrained sketch. I made the distance between the circuit board and the enclosure 0.10mm and the distance between the face and the enclosure 0.10mm. I also added a hole for the 4 LED lights and the speaker. For all the holes, I extruded a tunnel between the face and the electrical components, because I did not want the green circuit board to be visible from the user’s perspective. Also, I created a simple rectangular button, that looks like a bar from the igloo, to help the user access the control on the alarm clock. To make the button not fall out, I created an offset on the inner side of the rectangular prism. I made the distance between the button and the face 0.10mm. Lastly, to ensure that the enclosure holds the circuit board firm and flat, I made the back of the enclosure open and created some stoppers around the back without obstructing the solder.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">After 2 hours of print, I examined the fit of the newly printed enclosure and the face with the circuit board. Surprisingly, the fit between the circuit board and the enclosure is different for two identical prints – red and blue. They are loose on red but tight on blue. Meanwhile, the fit between the face and the enclosure is tight for both prints. After some thought, I decreased the distance between the circuit board and the enclosure by 0.05mm from 0.10mm to 0.05mm and decreased the distance between the face and the enclosure by 0.08mm from 0.10mm to 0.18mm. Next, I noticed that the face was weak, because it is thin; so, I doubled the thickness from 1.5mm to 3.0mm. Also, due to the height of the tunnel between the face and the four red lights, the face cannot lie on top of the circuit board. The tunnel is too long and small. So, I was not able to examine the fit between the face and the board. To address this, I forcibly removed those four tunnels. After seeing the three objects combined, I had a better sense of idea on the way to improve the design of the face. The face looked too flat, so I added a fillet for all the holes except the button. I decreased the depth of the tunnel for the lights while increasing it for the screen, as a good portion of the green board was still visible. Also, the button was not functionable, because there was too much resistance between the face and the button due to the lack of space; so, I increased the distance between them by 0.17mm from 0.10mm to 0.27mm. Then, I thought that the size of the hole for the screen was too large. I no longer felt that the dimension of the hole should match the outline of the screen but should match the visible area of the screen. So, I decreased the size. Next, I added an enclosure for the wire so that the board is not visible from the side. After some many more minor adjustments, I printed them again for three hours.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">The fit was a lot better overall. Only three minor adjustments were needed. Firstly, the fit between the face and the enclosure was loose now, so I decreased the distance by 0.09 mm from 0.18mm to 0.09mm. Secondly, the depth of the tunnel for the four red lights was still long, so I decreased the depth by 4.0mm. Thirdly, the face was not held strongly, that the surface would wobble when the pressure was applied on the face. To strengthen the face, I created a support on the enclosure so that the face would not be pushed into the enclosure.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">While the new face was being printed, my partner was making a finishing touch on the igloo. After inserting the derive of the enclosure, he created a holder for the battery behind the circuit board. Then, he exported it into STL and sliced it in PrusaSlicer. However, the bottom half of the igloo was not visible. After consulting with Professor Ian, we tried a Windows-based software that fixes mesh, but it did not work out. Then, we tried using Netfabb, which is a built-in service in the Windows edition of PrusaSlicer, and gladly, it fixed the corrupted mesh. My partner printed the igloo, but on his first try, the filament wire got tangled up, causing the print to stop midway. So, he reattempted, and the outcome looked amazing.</p>

The screen, speaker, and the four red lights are clearly visible, and the green circuit board is barely visible. My partner and I are very happy with how it turned out.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Some of the aspects of the outcome that I wish were different were that the alarm clock turned on and the battery box thicker. We made the battery box only 2mm thick, and it has ripped from its weakness.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Regarding the process, I think all the steps that were taken were good. My partner and I divided up the work fairly equally. He took some time in soldering, making initial measurements, and taking care of the igloo, while I made the design of the face and ensured all the components fit perfectly.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Besides that, to recap some of the key mistakes, the way we approached the measurement was not ideal. When we are measuring the location of certain components on the circuit board, we should measure the distance relative to a certain fixed point. Another mistake was rushing through the CAD by failing to consider how the circuit board would be placed in the enclosure. Nevertheless, despite some hiccups in the process, I think it was a successful and fairly smooth process without a big headache.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Overall, this was a highly successful project. The igloo looks beautiful with multicolor filament. It is sturdy. The fit between the igloo, the face, and the circuit board is perfect.</p>
