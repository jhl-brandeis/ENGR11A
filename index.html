                            <p class="card-text">I learned that it does not take a lot of time and does not require a lot of knowledge and skills to build a 3D printer. Building Prusa Mini+ was like building LEGO set with instruction but not a brick. The pieces were connected by some screws and electrical wires, and no glue was used. It took about an hour and half to complete the assembly. Overall, although there were some difficulties getting the three screws secured through the deep holes, with the gummy bears, it was a seamless and an enjoyable experience.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">However, if I could make one change to the Prusa Documentation, I would make the assembly instruction more visual and clearer. For LEGO assembly document, there is little to no words; each step can be clearly understood by the visual diagram and symbols. Although there are pictures and visual elements, at times, I found it hard to follow along. For example, when we had to find which holes to put the screw through, it was difficult to find the color-coded circle in the picture.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">One thing that was memorable is that some parts of the printer were 3D printed, so in a way, 3D printer was printing itself. However, many of the parts, such as the supporting metal beams and nozzle, were not 3D printed.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">After the 3D printer was turned on, it went through a calibration process. I have experience using and calibrating a 3D printer Creality Ender-3, and I developed a negative perception of calibration, because it is a difficult and time taking process of adjusting four screws. However, the calibration process on Prusa Mini+ was surprising a seamless experience. Before I manually made an adjustment, the printer uses its magnetic sheet and SuperPINDA located near the nozzle to calibrate the height between the sheet and the nozzle across the sheet. Then, I only had to adjust the height at one location, and the height was calibrated across the board.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">With the birth of a new priner, Greg and I brainstormed and decided to name the printer ‘Yuzu’, the citrus fruit. With that in mind, we chose a yellow filament.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Loading the filament was not the smoothest process. Unlike the Creality Ender-3, I was not sure how to create a distance between the two gears, so I kept pushing the filament in and repeatedly asked the printer to turn the gears. Hence, the gears had to push the filament until it reaches the nozzle. This took a few minutes, which would have been a few seconds in the Creality Ender-3.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">After the filament was purged through the nozzle, it started to calibrate again but with the filament. Unfortunately, in the test print, the line was not continuous. We consulted with Professor Roger. We test printed it again but saw the same result. The professor and us did not think that the distance between the sheet and the nozzle is a problem, so we were given a green light.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">For the final calibration step, we printed a universally recognized test ‘Benchy’. Benchy is a 3D model of a 3cm by 5.5cm by 5cm ship. The print did not turn out perfect. There were stringing in many locations and under-excursion at the bottom. So, we were confused if this is normal for this printer and on what the cause could be.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">After consulting with the instructors, it was found that the filament that we are using is not a normal PLA, but a composite silk. I googled it up and took a look at the filament’s manufacture website. They state that it needs to be printed at a higher temperature (around 220°C) and at a slower speed. So, I learned that the next time we use a composite silk, we have to set the temperature higher and speed slower.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Lastly, Greg and I explored various setting to make the print faster. We changed the infill pattern and the percentage. We noticed that when the infill is below 10%, the pattern is barely visible that it did not matter what the infill pattern was. And, based on the infill pattern and the percentage, some component of the ship would not be possible to print, especially the hole at the back of the ship. Some of the layers would be printing on the air without any support.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">We also increased the height of each layer and the preset to draft to decrease the printing time, although the print quality would decrease. We also lowered the number of layer of the bottom, top, and side. Most importantly, we increased the speed of the printer by 10-fold. We have shared our progress to our TA Vincent, but he warned that our modified printer’s speed would be overridden by the machine’s speed limit. However, he told us that we can modify the machine’s speed limit, so we have increased it by 10-fold. The predicted print time has decreased from about 90 minutes to 13 minutes. Next, we tried to print it, but the nozzle was moving at a concerningly fast speed. Professor Rogers and we were worried about the well-being of the printer, so we have decided to stop the print.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">The first layer that was printed was not looking good. The height of the first layer is too low. It is clear that the printer has tried to print the first layer of Benchy, but the speed of filament purging has not increased to counteract the speed of the printer.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Therefore, we have learned that it is not a good idea to override the machine’s speed limit and that when we increase the printer’s speed, the speed of filament purging should also increase. More importantly, when we are using the composite silk, we need to set the temperature higher and decrease the speed.</p>

I tried to get inspiration from something, and I started out with New York City, a place where I hope to reside. I thought of creating something artistic by using the Manhattan, the ship Benchy, and the figure of a businessman. Then, Professor Rogers approached me and advised me to fuse them together rather than just laying the pieces.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">I did not have a clear idea of how to fuse them together because I was concerned about the scaling of each object. Before the class ended, I wanted to print something, so I tried to print a Manhattan that I found on an online search engine for the 3D object Thingiverse, but I had trouble printing the entire Manhattan. The download contained one Sketch Up file and 51 STL files. The 3D object of Manhattan was divided into pieces of STLs. I tried to assemble them in Fusion 360, but it was soon clear that it would be a time-consuming task to assemble them in the software. Hence, I printed just one segment of Manhattan.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">When I came back, the print had a lot of oozing. I thought of using the heat gun to melt the strings away, but I decided to go back to the drawing board and rethink what useful object I could create.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">I went back to Thingiverse and searched for <a href="www.thingiverse.com/thing:1875661/files">an appropriate centurion model</a>. For example, I wanted one of his arms to be reaching forward so that I could add a cardholder. After importing the object to the Fusion 360, I created a cardholder. However, I had some difficulty combing the card holder and the army, because I was not able to remove the gun. Soon, my classmate Soho taught me that the army is in a mesh and showed me how to convert the mesh into a body. I had never heard of mesh in Fusion 360 and needed to learn the characteristics of mesh. Once it was converted to a body, I was easily able to add the cardholder. However, I decided to use the timeline feature to go back and remove the triangular mesh of the gun, as it gave me greater control. It was my first time removing a triangular mesh in Fusion 360, and I found it advantageous to delete one mesh at a time, yet it was time-consuming. If I thickened the brush even a bit, too many meshes would be deleted, so I mostly had to remove one mesh at a time - a tedious task.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">After the combination of the army and the cardholder looked perfect, I started to be concerned that the army may not be able to withstand the weight of the card and lose its balance. I wanted to add a stand where the army could stand on, but I did not want to add a boring square prism. Soon, I had an idea of using the American Express logo with Centurion on it. I went back to <a href="www.thingiverse.com/thing:5244595/files">Thingiverse</a> and imported the STL file. Next, I wanted the base to be thicker, so I added an elliptic cylinder. Similar to how I converted the army from the mesh to the body, I attempted to convert the logo to a body, but my computer could not handle the load. Unfortunately, I had to force quit the app, but on a positive note, my progress on Fusion 360 was auto saved. Soon, I realized there was no need to cover the logo to a body, so I opted not to.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Next, I thought having some text on the base would be nice, like a plat. However, I was not sure how to add text on the curved surface. I Googled it up and watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tawOD3CQW7I&ab_channel=adamjames">the how-to video</a>.</p>

The size of the logo came out good, and I felt confident that it was adequately big to withstand the weight of the card. I was also satisfied with how the details of the logo can be seen.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">However, there was some oozing. I could see some strings within the logo, but I did not find it problematic. Also, there was some underexcretion in the logo. I thought that if the filament size is smaller, the underexcretion can be addressed.</p>

Since there was sufficient time, I made the print quality ‘0.07mm ULTRADETAIL’. With the help of TA Vincent, I added organic support. And, with the advice of Lecturer Roy, I chose the purple filament in the hope that it would look well with the gold-color card. Also, the Lecturer was concerned the logo would not be visible and advised me to increase the height.</p>

It was difficult for me to examine if there was a sufficient connection between the logo and the feet that they would hold together tightly. However, I did not want to lower the leg too much, because I wanted the shoes to be visible. I used section analysis to examine if the relative distance between the logo and the shoes should be adjusted. After some other minor adjustments, I started the print.</p>

Some of the support materials were fallen and scattered on the logo, so the organic support has failed. Without the support material, the cardholder could not be printed well. And the logo was not clear from the oozing and had some underexcretion. Since the logo has depth, removing the oozing within the logo is nearly impossible. And the text around the base is not clearly visible because of the oozing. On top of that, the support material is tightly attached to it to the extent that some of the support material around the arm was too difficult to remove, and I accidentally ripped off a piece of the shoulder while detaching the support material. So, I decided not to risk and forcibly remove the support around the arms. Clearly, a lot had gone wrong.</p>

Firstly, the resolution of the print may have been too high, so the diameter of the printed filament may have been too thin that there was an occasional gap in the print. Throughout the print, I can see that the filament was not printed in some places, and it was clearly visible on the base of the logo. The filament may not have been consistently pushed out, and the lack of filament in the organic support may have caused the support to be weak and fall. Also, since the filament is thin, the inner thickness of the organic tree may be too thin, that it was not able to support itself.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Secondly, I can hypothesize that the 'bottom contact Z distance' for support material is too high. TA Vincent recommended that the distance be 0.4mm, which is double the default value. The space between the plat part of the logo and the tree may have been too big that the support material could not cling to the floor well. Again, it is hard for me to precisely identify the cause of the failed print.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">14. Next Time</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">The goal of this project was not achieved. The Centurion Army cannot hold a credit card, or I need to tape it to the holder, which would not be ideal.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Regarding design optimization, I think everything is good except for the elliptical base. The oval that I created is not perfect. It is a bit too wide, so the distance between the edges of the oval and the logo is not constant. I should use a caliper or measuring tool in Fusion 360 to measure the distance and polish up the size of the oval.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">I want to print this again, but I think I have to approach the printing differently. I should print one part of the model at a time and calibrate it with the printer to find the optimal setting. After finding the ideal setting, I will use the Prusa Slicer to divide the print into four pieces: the base with the logo and leg, the right side of the army, the left side of the army, and the cardholder. I do not think it is best to print the entire model in one print, and it is better to divide up the print.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">More importantly, I need to change the print setting. I will lower the infill density to 30% because I do not think there is a good reason to keep it at 50%. I will address the oozing by decreasing the temperature from the default of 210°C to 200°C, increasing the retraction speed from the default of 70mm/s to 100mm/s, increasing the retraction length from the default of 3.2mm to 4.0mm, increasing the lift Z during retraction from the default of 0.2mm to 0.5mm, reduce the minimum travel after retraction from the default of 1.5mm to 0.1mm, and reduce the retract amount before wipe from the default of 70% to 80%. I will address the underexcretion by increasing the extrusion multiplier from the default of 1 to 1.05. Also, I watched a <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP2_Asz7xK8">video</a> for homework on the updated version of Prusa Slicer, and I learned that there are several techniques that I can utilize with the latest software. To make the logo look nicer, I will iron the logo. If I do end up wanting to print everything in one print, I will ‘paint’ where I want the enforcement of the supports and use the organic support, but I will test print certain parts that are difficult to print before I print everything.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">This project began by soldering the alarm clock. The assembly kit had a circuit board, three displays, many resistors, four LED lights, and many more electrical components I was unfamiliar with. My partner and I have never soldered before, so we had much to learn quickly.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">The first problem was identifying the components and determining where they belong on the board. Some components are labeled with the code, and we identified them by referring to the instruction manual. However, many of the components were not labeled, and we had difficulty determining the direction of the components as the manual included unfamiliar jargon. So, we relied on some help from the instructors and TAs.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Once the components were identified, my partner and I took turns soldering, and since it was our first experience, we stumbled through the journey. We tried our best to mimic Professor Ian’s demonstration of soldering techniques, but we had difficulty controlling the flow and the size of the solder. The professors advised us to place the iron on the board and run the solder into it rather than trying to paint the solder, and this advice has helped us control the solder a lot more.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Nevertheless, we had to be careful not to let the applied solder cool down with the wire, as they would form a solid together, and the wire would attach to the board. So, we had to be wary of not letting the solder lie on the board too long.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Besides that, we also had to be cautious of not running too much solder on the board, as it would create a big sphere that would spill to their neighbors and merge them up. When such an incident occurs, we use a blue sucker that would satisfyingly suck the hot liquified solder and release it in solid. This was a useful skill that helped us undo the damage done.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">On the first day, we dipped our toes into the world of soldering and learned the fundamental skills.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">We had to create an enclosure that would house the alarm clock using the 3D printer, so we quickly measured the clock's width, length, and height. On the second day, we wanted to be mindful of the printing time. So, we decided to quickly make a simple enclosure in Fusion 360 and 3D print it.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">On Fusion 360, I applied many techniques, especially utilizing the feature Parameter, that I recently learned. After creating the 3D model, I sliced it using PrusaSlicer with a preset of “0.25mm DRAFT”. Before I printed it, I cleaned the plate with alcohol and ran a calibration on a printer but ran into a problem: the printer would not extrude any filament. With the help of the professors, we identified that there was rimming. While the TA was fixing the rimming, I tried to print with another printer, but that printer also had an issue of rimming. This time, I tried to fix it myself by unscrewing the tube connected to the motor and removing as much filament as I could from the machine. I was able to find the part of the filament that was rimming. After having confidence in identifying the cause of the problem, I placed the printer in ‘filament loading mode’ and tried to carefully push the filament through the motor. After some time, I was able to fix the rimming and start the 2.5 hours of print.</p>

We were confused because it was working well the other day. We tried to connect the new battery, but nothing was helping. Professor Ian diagnosed the issue and determined that the voltage was detected on the board, but somewhere in the circuit board, something went wrong. Even when the battery was attached to the system, the circuit board would not get warm, so we were all confused as to why it would not work overnight. With no clear idea of the cause of this issue, the only two options were to resolder the alarm clock and risk encountering the same issue or to move forward with the project.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">With the limited time given, we decided to devote our time to creating an enclosure by examining the fit of the 3D-printed enclosure. The print was successfully completed without a major issue. We tested the fit and realized that the sides of the circuit board were a little tight. Also, we realized that the enclosure was not perfectly printed, as there were some small dents sticking out. To remove the imperfection, we used a scraper with rough surfaces to scrape off the dents. After making the inner surface of the enclosure smooth, we reexamined the fit and determined that the tolerance should be increased by 0.10mm from 0.15mm to 0.25mm.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">We wanted to quickly know if the increase in tolerance was perfect, so we made a quick adjustment by simply changing the parameter ‘wiggleRoom’ and printing the top portion of the box. Rather than using Fusion 360 to remove the bottom portion of the box, I used PrusaSlicer and moved the box lower to remove the part that I did not wish to print. Since I was interested in finding the perfect tolerance for the width and the length of the alarm clock, a little bit needed to be printed, so only 33 minutes was needed.</p>

Using the measurements, I created a fully constrained sketch and a body on Fusion 360 using 24 parameters.</p>

So, my partner went on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23853/makes">Thingiverse.com to find the perfect enclosure</a> , which he chose to be an igloo. He imported it into Fusion 360, and we created a shared group project in Fusion 360 with the help of TA. With my help, he learned how to turn the mesh into a body. Since the igloo has a lot of mesh, we had to wait for his computer to convert it into a body.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">11. Rethinking the Approach to Measurement</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">After some contemplation, I realized that there may be a flaw in the measurement method. For example, it may not have been the best to measure the distance between each electrical component. For the screen, we measured the distance between the edge of the board and the start of the screen, the distance between the start and the end of the screen, the end of the screen and the start of the next screen, and so on. When the individual measurement of the screen was added up, it did not add up to the actual width of the board. It is 0.50mm or 0.51% bigger.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">To address this issue, I remeasured all the dimensions by measuring the relative distance to a certain point of the circuit board, mainly the top left corner. So, when I would measure the location of the start of the second screen, I would measure the distance between the top left corner of the clock and the start of the second screen rather than adding up the measurements. A total of 59 measurements were done and entered as a parameter.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">I noticed that there are differences in the measurement between mine and the one taken with my partner. Finding all the differences would be simple, as we have measure different thing and to compare the distance between two points, I would have to do some more computation. Nevertheless, the most obvious differences are the width and the length of the circuit board. It was previously measured as 97.49mm by 48.92mm, but I found it to be 97.46mm by 48.90, which is 2mm to 3mm difference in measurement. This is a minor difference, but one of the most visible differences was the vertical distance between the edge of the board and the start of the screen. It was previously measured as 4.26mm, but I found it to be 3.5mm, which is 18% smaller. It seems that no two measurements between the previous one and the new one are the same, due to the nature of the caliper. The caliper measures the distance in 0.01mm increments, which is very small. And, it is also not easy to control the caliper, especially when external jaws – a tool used to measure the outer dimension of an object – are not used. Due to the smallness of the electrical components, we had to rely a lot on the depth measuring blade – a tool used to measure the depth of an object relative to the surface – and it was the hardest tool to control, because adjusting the force that we apply to slider the caliper is challenging and it is hard to make an adjustment in 0.01mm increment due to the friction between the slides.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Spending a few hours, I created a face and a simple rectangular enclosure with one fully constrained sketch. I made the distance between the circuit board and the enclosure 0.10mm and the distance between the face and the enclosure 0.10mm. I also added a hole for the 4 LED lights and the speaker. For all the holes, I extruded a tunnel between the face and the electrical components, because I did not want the green circuit board to be visible from the user’s perspective. Also, I created a simple rectangular button, that looks like a bar from the igloo, to help the user access the control on the alarm clock. To make the button not fall out, I created an offset on the inner side of the rectangular prism. I made the distance between the button and the face 0.10mm. Lastly, to ensure that the enclosure holds the circuit board firm and flat, I made the back of the enclosure open and created some stoppers around the back without obstructing the solder.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">After 2 hours of print, I examined the fit of the newly printed enclosure and the face with the circuit board. Surprisingly, the fit between the circuit board and the enclosure is different for two identical prints – red and blue. They are loose on red but tight on blue. Meanwhile, the fit between the face and the enclosure is tight for both prints. After some thought, I decreased the distance between the circuit board and the enclosure by 0.05mm from 0.10mm to 0.05mm and decreased the distance between the face and the enclosure by 0.08mm from 0.10mm to 0.18mm. Next, I noticed that the face was weak, because it is thin; so, I doubled the thickness from 1.5mm to 3.0mm. Also, due to the height of the tunnel between the face and the four red lights, the face cannot lie on top of the circuit board. The tunnel is too long and small. So, I was not able to examine the fit between the face and the board. To address this, I forcibly removed those four tunnels. After seeing the three objects combined, I had a better sense of idea on the way to improve the design of the face. The face looked too flat, so I added a fillet for all the holes except the button. I decreased the depth of the tunnel for the lights while increasing it for the screen, as a good portion of the green board was still visible. Also, the button was not functionable, because there was too much resistance between the face and the button due to the lack of space; so, I increased the distance between them by 0.17mm from 0.10mm to 0.27mm. Then, I thought that the size of the hole for the screen was too large. I no longer felt that the dimension of the hole should match the outline of the screen but should match the visible area of the screen. So, I decreased the size. Next, I added an enclosure for the wire so that the board is not visible from the side. After some many more minor adjustments, I printed them again for three hours.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">The fit was a lot better overall. Only three minor adjustments were needed. Firstly, the fit between the face and the enclosure was loose now, so I decreased the distance by 0.09 mm from 0.18mm to 0.09mm. Secondly, the depth of the tunnel for the four red lights was still long, so I decreased the depth by 4.0mm. Thirdly, the face was not held strongly, that the surface would wobble when the pressure was applied on the face. To strengthen the face, I created a support on the enclosure so that the face would not be pushed into the enclosure.</p>

Everything was perfect, except that the circuit board could not be placed in the enclosure, because there are the supports to prevent the face and circuit board from being pushed in too much. I failed to realize that the circuit board needed a way to get into the enclosure. Therefore, I removed the support for the face and placed the support on the face so that the face could not be pushed too far into the enclosure that it should be.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">While the new face was being printed, my partner was making a finishing touch on the igloo. After inserting the derive of the enclosure, he created a holder for the battery behind the circuit board. Then, he exported it into STL and sliced it in PrusaSlicer. However, the bottom half of the igloo was not visible. After consulting with Professor Ian, we tried a Windows-based software that fixes mesh, but it did not work out. Then, we tried using Netfabb, which is a built-in service in the Windows edition of PrusaSlicer, and gladly, it fixed the corrupted mesh. My partner printed the igloo, but on his first try, the filament wire got tangled up, causing the print to stop midway. So, he reattempted, and the outcome looked amazing.</p>

The screen, speaker, and the four red lights are clearly visible, and the green circuit board is barely visible. My partner and I are very happy with how it turned out.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Some of the aspects of the outcome that I wish were different were that the alarm clock turned on and the battery box thicker. We made the battery box only 2mm thick, and it has ripped from its weakness.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Regarding the process, I think all the steps that were taken were good. My partner and I divided up the work fairly equally. He took some time in soldering, making initial measurements, and taking care of the igloo, while I made the design of the face and ensured all the components fit perfectly.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Besides that, to recap some of the key mistakes, the way we approached the measurement was not ideal. When we are measuring the location of certain components on the circuit board, we should measure the distance relative to a certain fixed point. Another mistake was rushing through the CAD by failing to consider how the circuit board would be placed in the enclosure. Nevertheless, despite some hiccups in the process, I think it was a successful and fairly smooth process without a big headache.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Overall, this was a highly successful project. The igloo looks beautiful with multicolor filament. It is sturdy. The fit between the igloo, the face, and the circuit board is perfect.</p>
