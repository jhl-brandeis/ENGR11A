                            <p class="card-text">I learned that it does not take a lot of time and does not require a lot of knowledge and skills to build a 3D printer. Building Prusa Mini+ was like building LEGO set with instruction but not a brick. The pieces were connected by some screws and electrical wires, and no glue was used. It took about an hour and half to complete the assembly. Overall, although there were some difficulties getting the three screws secured through the deep holes, with the gummy bears, it was a seamless and an enjoyable experience.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">However, if I could make one change to the Prusa Documentation, I would make the assembly instruction more visual and clearer. For LEGO assembly document, there is little to no words; each step can be clearly understood by the visual diagram and symbols. Although there are pictures and visual elements, at times, I found it hard to follow along. For example, when we had to find which holes to put the screw through, it was difficult to find the color-coded circle in the picture.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">One thing that was memorable is that some parts of the printer were 3D printed, so in a way, 3D printer was printing itself. However, many of the parts, such as the supporting metal beams and nozzle, were not 3D printed.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">After the 3D printer was turned on, it went through a calibration process. I have experience using and calibrating a 3D printer Creality Ender-3, and I developed a negative perception of calibration, because it is a difficult and time taking process of adjusting four screws. However, the calibration process on Prusa Mini+ was surprising a seamless experience. Before I manually made an adjustment, the printer uses its magnetic sheet and SuperPINDA located near the nozzle to calibrate the height between the sheet and the nozzle across the sheet. Then, I only had to adjust the height at one location, and the height was calibrated across the board.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">With the birth of a new priner, Greg and I brainstormed and decided to name the printer ‘Yuzu’, the citrus fruit. With that in mind, we chose a yellow filament.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Loading the filament was not the smoothest process. Unlike the Creality Ender-3, I was not sure how to create a distance between the two gears, so I kept pushing the filament in and repeatedly asked the printer to turn the gears. Hence, the gears had to push the filament until it reaches the nozzle. This took a few minutes, which would have been a few seconds in the Creality Ender-3.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">After the filament was purged through the nozzle, it started to calibrate again but with the filament. Unfortunately, in the test print, the line was not continuous. We consulted with Professor Roger. We test printed it again but saw the same result. The professor and us did not think that the distance between the sheet and the nozzle is a problem, so we were given a green light.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">For the final calibration step, we printed a universally recognized test ‘Benchy’. Benchy is a 3D model of a 3cm by 5.5cm by 5cm ship. The print did not turn out perfect. There were stringing in many locations and under-excursion at the bottom. So, we were confused if this is normal for this printer and on what the cause could be.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">After consulting with the instructors, it was found that the filament that we are using is not a normal PLA, but a composite silk. I googled it up and took a look at the filament’s manufacture website. They state that it needs to be printed at a higher temperature (around 220°C) and at a slower speed. So, I learned that the next time we use a composite silk, we have to set the temperature higher and speed slower.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Lastly, Greg and I explored various setting to make the print faster. We changed the infill pattern and the percentage. We noticed that when the infill is below 10%, the pattern is barely visible that it did not matter what the infill pattern was. And, based on the infill pattern and the percentage, some component of the ship would not be possible to print, especially the hole at the back of the ship. Some of the layers would be printing on the air without any support.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">We also increased the height of each layer and the preset to draft to decrease the printing time, although the print quality would decrease. We also lowered the number of layer of the bottom, top, and side. Most importantly, we increased the speed of the printer by 10-fold. We have shared our progress to our TA Vincent, but he warned that our modified printer’s speed would be overridden by the machine’s speed limit. However, he told us that we can modify the machine’s speed limit, so we have increased it by 10-fold. The predicted print time has decreased from about 90 minutes to 13 minutes. Next, we tried to print it, but the nozzle was moving at a concerningly fast speed. Professor Rogers and we were worried about the well-being of the printer, so we have decided to stop the print.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">The first layer that was printed was not looking good. The height of the first layer is too low. It is clear that the printer has tried to print the first layer of Benchy, but the speed of filament purging has not increased to counteract the speed of the printer.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Therefore, we have learned that it is not a good idea to override the machine’s speed limit and that when we increase the printer’s speed, the speed of filament purging should also increase. More importantly, when we are using the composite silk, we need to set the temperature higher and decrease the speed.</p>

I tried to get inspiration from something, and I started out with New York City, a place where I hope to reside. I thought of creating something artistic by using the Manhattan, the ship Benchy, and the figure of a businessman. Then, Professor Rogers approached me and advised me to fuse them together rather than just laying the pieces.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">I did not have a clear idea of how to fuse them together because I was concerned about the scaling of each object. Before the class ended, I wanted to print something, so I tried to print a Manhattan that I found on an online search engine for the 3D object Thingiverse, but I had trouble printing the entire Manhattan. The download contained one Sketch Up file and 51 STL files. The 3D object of Manhattan was divided into pieces of STLs. I tried to assemble them in Fusion 360, but it was soon clear that it would be a time-consuming task to assemble them in the software. Hence, I printed just one segment of Manhattan.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">When I came back, the print had a lot of oozing. I thought of using the heat gun to melt the strings away, but I decided to go back to the drawing board and rethink what useful object I could create.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">I went back to Thingiverse and searched for <a href="www.thingiverse.com/thing:1875661/files">an appropriate centurion model</a>. For example, I wanted one of his arms to be reaching forward so that I could add a cardholder. After importing the object to the Fusion 360, I created a cardholder. However, I had some difficulty combing the card holder and the army, because I was not able to remove the gun. Soon, my classmate Soho taught me that the army is in a mesh and showed me how to convert the mesh into a body. I had never heard of mesh in Fusion 360 and needed to learn the characteristics of mesh. Once it was converted to a body, I was easily able to add the cardholder. However, I decided to use the timeline feature to go back and remove the triangular mesh of the gun, as it gave me greater control. It was my first time removing a triangular mesh in Fusion 360, and I found it advantageous to delete one mesh at a time, yet it was time-consuming. If I thickened the brush even a bit, too many meshes would be deleted, so I mostly had to remove one mesh at a time - a tedious task.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">After the combination of the army and the cardholder looked perfect, I started to be concerned that the army may not be able to withstand the weight of the card and lose its balance. I wanted to add a stand where the army could stand on, but I did not want to add a boring square prism. Soon, I had an idea of using the American Express logo with Centurion on it. I went back to <a href="www.thingiverse.com/thing:5244595/files">Thingiverse</a> and imported the STL file. Next, I wanted the base to be thicker, so I added an elliptic cylinder. Similar to how I converted the army from the mesh to the body, I attempted to convert the logo to a body, but my computer could not handle the load. Unfortunately, I had to force quit the app, but on a positive note, my progress on Fusion 360 was auto saved. Soon, I realized there was no need to cover the logo to a body, so I opted not to.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Next, I thought having some text on the base would be nice, like a plat. However, I was not sure how to add text on the curved surface. I Googled it up and watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tawOD3CQW7I&ab_channel=adamjames">the how-to video</a>.</p>

The size of the logo came out good, and I felt confident that it was adequately big to withstand the weight of the card. I was also satisfied with how the details of the logo can be seen.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">However, there was some oozing. I could see some strings within the logo, but I did not find it problematic. Also, there was some underexcretion in the logo. I thought that if the filament size is smaller, the underexcretion can be addressed.</p>

Since there was sufficient time, I made the print quality ‘0.07mm ULTRADETAIL’. With the help of TA Vincent, I added organic support. And, with the advice of Lecturer Roy, I chose the purple filament in the hope that it would look well with the gold-color card. Also, the Lecturer was concerned the logo would not be visible and advised me to increase the height.</p>

It was difficult for me to examine if there was a sufficient connection between the logo and the feet that they would hold together tightly. However, I did not want to lower the leg too much, because I wanted the shoes to be visible. I used section analysis to examine if the relative distance between the logo and the shoes should be adjusted. After some other minor adjustments, I started the print.</p>

Some of the support materials were fallen and scattered on the logo, so the organic support has failed. Without the support material, the cardholder could not be printed well. And the logo was not clear from the oozing and had some underexcretion. Since the logo has depth, removing the oozing within the logo is nearly impossible. And the text around the base is not clearly visible because of the oozing. On top of that, the support material is tightly attached to it to the extent that some of the support material around the arm was too difficult to remove, and I accidentally ripped off a piece of the shoulder while detaching the support material. So, I decided not to risk and forcibly remove the support around the arms. Clearly, a lot had gone wrong.</p>

Firstly, the resolution of the print may have been too high, so the diameter of the printed filament may have been too thin that there was an occasional gap in the print. Throughout the print, I can see that the filament was not printed in some places, and it was clearly visible on the base of the logo. The filament may not have been consistently pushed out, and the lack of filament in the organic support may have caused the support to be weak and fall. Also, since the filament is thin, the inner thickness of the organic tree may be too thin, that it was not able to support itself.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Secondly, I can hypothesize that the 'bottom contact Z distance' for support material is too high. TA Vincent recommended that the distance be 0.4mm, which is double the default value. The space between the plat part of the logo and the tree may have been too big that the support material could not cling to the floor well. Again, it is hard for me to precisely identify the cause of the failed print.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">14. Next Time</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">The goal of this project was not achieved. The Centurion Army cannot hold a credit card, or I need to tape it to the holder, which would not be ideal.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Regarding design optimization, I think everything is good except for the elliptical base. The oval that I created is not perfect. It is a bit too wide, so the distance between the edges of the oval and the logo is not constant. I should use a caliper or measuring tool in Fusion 360 to measure the distance and polish up the size of the oval.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">I want to print this again, but I think I have to approach the printing differently. I should print one part of the model at a time and calibrate it with the printer to find the optimal setting. After finding the ideal setting, I will use the Prusa Slicer to divide the print into four pieces: the base with the logo and leg, the right side of the army, the left side of the army, and the cardholder. I do not think it is best to print the entire model in one print, and it is better to divide up the print.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">More importantly, I need to change the print setting. I will lower the infill density to 30% because I do not think there is a good reason to keep it at 50%. I will address the oozing by decreasing the temperature from the default of 210°C to 200°C, increasing the retraction speed from the default of 70mm/s to 100mm/s, increasing the retraction length from the default of 3.2mm to 4.0mm, increasing the lift Z during retraction from the default of 0.2mm to 0.5mm, reduce the minimum travel after retraction from the default of 1.5mm to 0.1mm, and reduce the retract amount before wipe from the default of 70% to 80%. I will address the underexcretion by increasing the extrusion multiplier from the default of 1 to 1.05. Also, I watched a <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP2_Asz7xK8">video</a> for homework on the updated version of Prusa Slicer, and I learned that there are several techniques that I can utilize with the latest software. To make the logo look nicer, I will iron the logo. If I do end up wanting to print everything in one print, I will ‘paint’ where I want the enforcement of the supports and use the organic support, but I will test print certain parts that are difficult to print before I print everything.</p>
