                            <p class="card-text">I learned that it does not take a lot of time and does not require a lot of knowledge and skills to build a 3D printer. Building Prusa Mini+ was like building LEGO set with instruction but not a brick. The pieces were connected by some screws and electrical wires, and no glue was used. It took about an hour and half to complete the assembly. Overall, although there were some difficulties getting the three screws secured through the deep holes, with the gummy bears, it was a seamless and an enjoyable experience.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">However, if I could make one change to the Prusa Documentation, I would make the assembly instruction more visual and clearer. For LEGO assembly document, there is little to no words; each step can be clearly understood by the visual diagram and symbols. Although there are pictures and visual elements, at times, I found it hard to follow along. For example, when we had to find which holes to put the screw through, it was difficult to find the color-coded circle in the picture.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">One thing that was memorable is that some parts of the printer were 3D printed, so in a way, 3D printer was printing itself. However, many of the parts, such as the supporting metal beams and nozzle, were not 3D printed.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">After the 3D printer was turned on, it went through a calibration process. I have experience using and calibrating a 3D printer Creality Ender-3, and I developed a negative perception of calibration, because it is a difficult and time taking process of adjusting four screws. However, the calibration process on Prusa Mini+ was surprising a seamless experience. Before I manually made an adjustment, the printer uses its magnetic sheet and SuperPINDA located near the nozzle to calibrate the height between the sheet and the nozzle across the sheet. Then, I only had to adjust the height at one location, and the height was calibrated across the board.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">With the birth of a new priner, Greg and I brainstormed and decided to name the printer ‘Yuzu’, the citrus fruit. With that in mind, we chose a yellow filament.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Loading the filament was not the smoothest process. Unlike the Creality Ender-3, I was not sure how to create a distance between the two gears, so I kept pushing the filament in and repeatedly asked the printer to turn the gears. Hence, the gears had to push the filament until it reaches the nozzle. This took a few minutes, which would have been a few seconds in the Creality Ender-3.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">After the filament was purged through the nozzle, it started to calibrate again but with the filament. Unfortunately, in the test print, the line was not continuous. We consulted with Professor Roger. We test printed it again but saw the same result. The professor and us did not think that the distance between the sheet and the nozzle is a problem, so we were given a green light.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">For the final calibration step, we printed a universally recognized test ‘Benchy’. Benchy is a 3D model of a 3cm by 5.5cm by 5cm ship. The print did not turn out perfect. There were stringing in many locations and under-excursion at the bottom. So, we were confused if this is normal for this printer and on what the cause could be.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">After consulting with the instructors, it was found that the filament that we are using is not a normal PLA, but a composite silk. I googled it up and took a look at the filament’s manufacture website. They state that it needs to be printed at a higher temperature (around 220°C) and at a slower speed. So, I learned that the next time we use a composite silk, we have to set the temperature higher and speed slower.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">4. Print Faster!</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">Lastly, Greg and I explored various setting to make the print faster. We changed the infill pattern and the percentage. We noticed that when the infill is below 10%, the pattern is barely visible that it did not matter what the infill pattern was. And, based on the infill pattern and the percentage, some component of the ship would not be possible to print, especially the hole at the back of the ship. Some of the layers would be printing on the air without any support.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">We also increased the height of each layer and the preset to draft to decrease the printing time, although the print quality would decrease. We also lowered the number of layer of the bottom, top, and side. Most importantly, we increased the speed of the printer by 10-fold. We have shared our progress to our TA Vincent, but he warned that our modified printer’s speed would be overridden by the machine’s speed limit. However, he told us that we can modify the machine’s speed limit, so we have increased it by 10-fold. The predicted print time has decreased from about 90 minutes to 13 minutes. Next, we tried to print it, but the nozzle was moving at a concerningly fast speed. Professor Rogers and we were worried about the well-being of the printer, so we have decided to stop the print.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">The first layer that was printed was not looking good. The height of the first layer is too low. It is clear that the printer has tried to print the first layer of Benchy, but the speed of filament purging has not increased to counteract the speed of the printer.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Therefore, we have learned that it is not a good idea to override the machine’s speed limit and that when we increase the printer’s speed, the speed of filament purging should also increase. More importantly, when we are using the composite silk, we need to set the temperature higher and decrease the speed.</p>
