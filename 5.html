                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">1. Idea</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">I have never used a laser cut, so this is a learning curve. For this project, I will be creating an enclosure for the same alarm clock used in the previous project. This subtractive process is new to me, and I found it a bit more challenging to come up with an enclosure idea. A 3mm thick plywood will be cut, and I need to think in terms of a collection of walls that somehow have to be attached to each other to hold the entire enclosure in place. For the attachment system, I decided to use the same one that my TA has used. Two pieces of plywood interlock each other by a part of a piece going through a tight hole of another piece.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Regarding the design, I wanted the time and 4 LED lights to be clearly visible from various angles, so I made the visible area of the face big. To control the clock, I made T-shape blocks that will help me access the three buttons located under the face. To hold the battery and to make it accessible, I made a lid that can be opened and closed. To allow the clock to be connected to the battery, which will be separated by a wall, I created two holes on the left wall so that the wire can go through it.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">I wanted an enclosure that was elegant, futuristic, and round, so I sketched it in both 2D on paper and 3D on Fusion 360. On the 3D sketch, no parameter was used. In the 2D sketch, I indicated the dimensions. One of the main reasons I created a 3D sketch on Fusion 360 without using a parameter was because I wanted to experience creating a series of 2D sketches in different planes and understand the limitations of Fusion 360 without getting caught up on the detail and the dimensions.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">After getting a sense of the workflow needed in Fusion 360, I input all the parameters needed into a new file. A total of 8 different 2D sketches will be created, so I need to be careful on where I initiate the plane of the 2D sketch.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">The most difficult and stressful part of this CAD is creating an attachment system. I used the existing attachment system that my TA has used. This saved me a lot of time as I did not have to invest my time in creating one, but the problem was installing it on each of the walls in the correct location. It was time-consuming to move the TA's attachment system to two different sketches and align them perfectly so that when I got to laser print the plywood and attach the two different pieces, they interlock correctly and in the intended place.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Unlike 3D printing, where I can simply export it into STL, I have to export each 2D sketch into a DXF file, which is a vector file used in Adobe Illustrator. Each DXF file contains information on one piece or one wall of the enclosure, so each file has information on where the laser cutter should cut. I imported those 8 DXF files into Lightburn software, which takes care of CAM. Using the Lightburn, I identified a problem. Some of the vectors overlap each other, and this causes the laser cutter to cut on the same location multiple times. Hence, I had to go back to Fusion 360. To export the DXF file, I decided to create a new sketch and use the feature 'project'. In this way, I created an identical 2D sketch of the original but without duplicating lines. After some time, I had a perfect Lightburn file ready to be cut.</p>

After a quick self-calibration, it was lasering into the plywood, burning it. After 7 minutes, it was all cut. It was cool seeing it cut and finished in less than 10 minutes, which is much faster than 3D printing, an additive process. The edges of the pieces were ashy, and the plywood had a smell of its burn.</p>

Overall, the design is as elegant as it was intended. One of the problems was that the wire could not go through the two holes, and the hole for the clock was not placed in the correct location. Secondly, the cut for the face is a bit too low. I should have cut it a bit higher. Thirdly, the T-shape buttons can be better by being bigger so that they can be pressed more easily. Nevertheless, the final product is well made. No glue was needed to assemble it, and the attachment system holds up very well. The lid of the enclosure opens and closes elegantly. Pressing the button is satisfying with its haptic and its vibration. I am happy with how everything has turned out. If I had more time, I would love to make the minor adjustments in the parameters and print it in acrylic.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Due to the scheduling and timing issues, my partner and I used a pre-printed piece to assemble the hand. Along with the 3D printed parts, we used an assembly kit purchased for this prosthetic device, and a scissor and a screwdriver were the necessary tools needed to assemble it. For the guidance, we mainly used the written instructions to assemble it, but since the instruction was written for the previous version, we relied on the video for some parts, such as attaching the string. The overall assembly was smooth, but there were some incidents. Firstly, we made a mistake when attaching the pin for the middle and index fingers. We attached the pin after lining up the index finger without also lining up the middle finger. This was a problem because the middle finger cannot be attached to the hand. To pull the pin out, we had to use some sharp objects to forcibly push it out. Secondly, we were not sure how to tie the string at both ends. We wanted it to be sturdy, yet we did not know the best way to tie a single string rope, as we mainly have experience tying two strings together. Regardless, we tried our best and made multiple nodes to ensure that it would withstand great tension. Thirdly, we were confused about how the strings work and their role. We knew that the strings were meant to squeeze the hand but were not sure how it exactly worked. So, we looked at the video carefully and our classmate's finished product for reference. This helped us get a better sense of the idea of how the string should be attached and incorporated into the hand. Lastly, we struggled the most with calibrating the string to optimize the grip. The grip was loss, because we did not follow the instructions carefully and tie the string when the hand is folded at 30Â°. So, we had to untie the string and adjust the three metal screws. Some strings were tied so tightly that we cut them off and attached a new string. Overall, although it took more than two hours to assemble it, it was fairly smooth as any obstacles were overcome relatively quickly and simply.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">If I ever needed a prosthetic hand, I would want a customized version of a hand that is tailored to sculpturing, one of my favorite activities. For this art activity, several tools are needed: wire-end modeling, smooth modeling, carving, and detailing. These tools will be on each of the fingertips. Assuming that each hand can be controlled individually, such a prosthetic device can be beneficial when sculpturing because all the tools will be on their fingertip rather than having to drop off the tool, find the new one, and pick it up. This can save time. Also, having it on the fingertip could give greater control because it is built on the device and is sturdier and stable.</p>

At the top left corner of the board, there is a little dent that was causing the distance between the board and enclosure to be different across the edges. So, we decided to remove the dent by using the scraper with rough surfaces to sand it off.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">We wanted to create an aesthetically pleasing enclosure for the alarm clock that is not a boring rectangular prism. So, my partner went on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23853/makes">Thingiverse.com to find the perfect enclosure</a> , which he chose to be an igloo. He imported it into Fusion 360, and we created a shared group project in Fusion 360 with the help of TA. With my help, he learned how to turn the mesh into a body. Since the igloo has a lot of mesh, we had to wait for his computer to convert it into a body.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">11. Rethinking the Approach to Measurement</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">After some contemplation, I realized that there may be a flaw in the measurement method. For example, it may not have been the best to measure the distance between each electrical component. For the screen, we measured the distance between the edge of the board and the start of the screen, the distance between the start and the end of the screen, the end of the screen and the start of the next screen, and so on. When the individual measurement of the screen was added up, it did not add up to the actual width of the board. It is 0.50mm or 0.51% bigger.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">To address this issue, I remeasured all the dimensions by measuring the relative distance to a certain point of the circuit board, mainly the top left corner. So, when I would measure the location of the start of the second screen, I would measure the distance between the top left corner of the clock and the start of the second screen rather than adding up the measurements. A total of 59 measurements were done and entered as a parameter.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">I noticed that there are differences in the measurement between mine and the one taken with my partner. Finding all the differences would be simple, as we have measure different thing and to compare the distance between two points, I would have to do some more computation. Nevertheless, the most obvious differences are the width and the length of the circuit board. It was previously measured as 97.49mm by 48.92mm, but I found it to be 97.46mm by 48.90, which is 2mm to 3mm difference in measurement. This is a minor difference, but one of the most visible differences was the vertical distance between the edge of the board and the start of the screen. It was previously measured as 4.26mm, but I found it to be 3.5mm, which is 18% smaller. It seems that no two measurements between the previous one and the new one are the same, due to the nature of the caliper. The caliper measures the distance in 0.01mm increments, which is very small. And, it is also not easy to control the caliper, especially when external jaws â€“ a tool used to measure the outer dimension of an object â€“ are not used. Due to the smallness of the electrical components, we had to rely a lot on the depth measuring blade â€“ a tool used to measure the depth of an object relative to the surface â€“ and it was the hardest tool to control, because adjusting the force that we apply to slider the caliper is challenging and it is hard to make an adjustment in 0.01mm increment due to the friction between the slides.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Spending a few hours, I created a face and a simple rectangular enclosure with one fully constrained sketch. I made the distance between the circuit board and the enclosure 0.10mm and the distance between the face and the enclosure 0.10mm. I also added a hole for the 4 LED lights and the speaker. For all the holes, I extruded a tunnel between the face and the electrical components, because I did not want the green circuit board to be visible from the userâ€™s perspective. Also, I created a simple rectangular button, that looks like a bar from the igloo, to help the user access the control on the alarm clock. To make the button not fall out, I created an offset on the inner side of the rectangular prism. I made the distance between the button and the face 0.10mm. Lastly, to ensure that the enclosure holds the circuit board firm and flat, I made the back of the enclosure open and created some stoppers around the back without obstructing the solder.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">After 2 hours of print, I examined the fit of the newly printed enclosure and the face with the circuit board. Surprisingly, the fit between the circuit board and the enclosure is different for two identical prints â€“ red and blue. They are loose on red but tight on blue. Meanwhile, the fit between the face and the enclosure is tight for both prints. After some thought, I decreased the distance between the circuit board and the enclosure by 0.05mm from 0.10mm to 0.05mm and decreased the distance between the face and the enclosure by 0.08mm from 0.10mm to 0.18mm. Next, I noticed that the face was weak, because it is thin; so, I doubled the thickness from 1.5mm to 3.0mm. Also, due to the height of the tunnel between the face and the four red lights, the face cannot lie on top of the circuit board. The tunnel is too long and small. So, I was not able to examine the fit between the face and the board. To address this, I forcibly removed those four tunnels. After seeing the three objects combined, I had a better sense of idea on the way to improve the design of the face. The face looked too flat, so I added a fillet for all the holes except the button. I decreased the depth of the tunnel for the lights while increasing it for the screen, as a good portion of the green board was still visible. Also, the button was not functionable, because there was too much resistance between the face and the button due to the lack of space; so, I increased the distance between them by 0.17mm from 0.10mm to 0.27mm. Then, I thought that the size of the hole for the screen was too large. I no longer felt that the dimension of the hole should match the outline of the screen but should match the visible area of the screen. So, I decreased the size. Next, I added an enclosure for the wire so that the board is not visible from the side. After some many more minor adjustments, I printed them again for three hours.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">The fit was a lot better overall. Only three minor adjustments were needed. Firstly, the fit between the face and the enclosure was loose now, so I decreased the distance by 0.09 mm from 0.18mm to 0.09mm. Secondly, the depth of the tunnel for the four red lights was still long, so I decreased the depth by 4.0mm. Thirdly, the face was not held strongly, that the surface would wobble when the pressure was applied on the face. To strengthen the face, I created a support on the enclosure so that the face would not be pushed into the enclosure.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">While the new face was being printed, my partner was making a finishing touch on the igloo. After inserting the derive of the enclosure, he created a holder for the battery behind the circuit board. Then, he exported it into STL and sliced it in PrusaSlicer. However, the bottom half of the igloo was not visible. After consulting with Professor Ian, we tried a Windows-based software that fixes mesh, but it did not work out. Then, we tried using Netfabb, which is a built-in service in the Windows edition of PrusaSlicer, and gladly, it fixed the corrupted mesh. My partner printed the igloo, but on his first try, the filament wire got tangled up, causing the print to stop midway. So, he reattempted, and the outcome looked amazing.</p>

The screen, speaker, and the four red lights are clearly visible, and the green circuit board is barely visible. My partner and I are very happy with how it turned out.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Some of the aspects of the outcome that I wish were different were that the alarm clock turned on and the battery box thicker. We made the battery box only 2mm thick, and it has ripped from its weakness.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Regarding the process, I think all the steps that were taken were good. My partner and I divided up the work fairly equally. He took some time in soldering, making initial measurements, and taking care of the igloo, while I made the design of the face and ensured all the components fit perfectly.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Besides that, to recap some of the key mistakes, the way we approached the measurement was not ideal. When we are measuring the location of certain components on the circuit board, we should measure the distance relative to a certain fixed point. Another mistake was rushing through the CAD by failing to consider how the circuit board would be placed in the enclosure. Nevertheless, despite some hiccups in the process, I think it was a successful and fairly smooth process without a big headache.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Overall, this was a highly successful project. The igloo looks beautiful with multicolor filament. It is sturdy. The fit between the igloo, the face, and the circuit board is perfect.</p>
