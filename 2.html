                            <p class="card-text">For the Week 2 Project, I explored CAD and CAM in greater detail by remixing 3D files. I imported some 3D models from online and combined them using Fusion 360 to create a new usage. Inspired by the American Express centurion army, I created a stand for their credit card, in which the army is standing on the logo and defending himself with the card.</p>

I tried to get inspiration from something, and I started out with New York City, a place where I hope to reside. I thought of creating something artistic by using the Manhattan, the ship Benchy, and the figure of a businessman. Then, Professor Rogers approached me and advised me to fuse them together rather than just laying the pieces.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">I did not have a clear idea of how to fuse them together because I was concerned about the scaling of each object. Before the class ended, I wanted to print something, so I tried to print a Manhattan that I found on an online search engine for the 3D object Thingiverse, but I had trouble printing the entire Manhattan. The download contained one Sketch Up file and 51 STL files. The 3D object of Manhattan was divided into pieces of STLs. I tried to assemble them in Fusion 360, but it was soon clear that it would be a time-consuming task to assemble them in the software. Hence, I printed just one segment of Manhattan.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">When I came back, the print had a lot of oozing. I thought of using the heat gun to melt the strings away, but I decided to go back to the drawing board and rethink what useful object I could create.</p>

My third proposal was a character figure that could be attached to the shoes like an attachment for crocks. Gladly, Instructor Ian liked all of the ideas. As a loyal customer of American Express, I decided to go with the Centurion Army because I thought it would be useful for me.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">I went back to Thingiverse and searched for <a href="www.thingiverse.com/thing:1875661/files">an appropriate centurion model</a>. For example, I wanted one of his arms to be reaching forward so that I could add a cardholder. After importing the object to the Fusion 360, I created a cardholder. However, I had some difficulty combing the card holder and the army, because I was not able to remove the gun. Soon, my classmate Soho taught me that the army is in a mesh and showed me how to convert the mesh into a body. I had never heard of mesh in Fusion 360 and needed to learn the characteristics of mesh. Once it was converted to a body, I was easily able to add the cardholder. However, I decided to use the timeline feature to go back and remove the triangular mesh of the gun, as it gave me greater control. It was my first time removing a triangular mesh in Fusion 360, and I found it advantageous to delete one mesh at a time, yet it was time-consuming. If I thickened the brush even a bit, too many meshes would be deleted, so I mostly had to remove one mesh at a time - a tedious task.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">After the combination of the army and the cardholder looked perfect, I started to be concerned that the army may not be able to withstand the weight of the card and lose its balance. I wanted to add a stand where the army could stand on, but I did not want to add a boring square prism. Soon, I had an idea of using the American Express logo with Centurion on it. I went back to <a href="www.thingiverse.com/thing:5244595/files">Thingiverse</a> and imported the STL file. Next, I wanted the base to be thicker, so I added an elliptic cylinder. Similar to how I converted the army from the mesh to the body, I attempted to convert the logo to a body, but my computer could not handle the load. Unfortunately, I had to force quit the app, but on a positive note, my progress on Fusion 360 was auto saved. Soon, I realized there was no need to cover the logo to a body, so I opted not to.</p>

Since there was sufficient time, I made the print quality ‘0.07mm ULTRADETAIL’. With the help of TA Vincent, I added organic support. And, with the advice of Lecturer Roy, I chose the purple filament in the hope that it would look well with the gold-color card. Also, the Lecturer was concerned the logo would not be visible and advised me to increase the height.</p>

It was difficult for me to examine if there was a sufficient connection between the logo and the feet that they would hold together tightly. However, I did not want to lower the leg too much, because I wanted the shoes to be visible. I used section analysis to examine if the relative distance between the logo and the shoes should be adjusted. After some other minor adjustments, I started the print.</p>

Some of the support materials were fallen and scattered on the logo, so the organic support has failed. Without the support material, the cardholder could not be printed well. And the logo was not clear from the oozing and had some underexcretion. Since the logo has depth, removing the oozing within the logo is nearly impossible. And the text around the base is not clearly visible because of the oozing. On top of that, the support material is tightly attached to it to the extent that some of the support material around the arm was too difficult to remove, and I accidentally ripped off a piece of the shoulder while detaching the support material. So, I decided not to risk and forcibly remove the support around the arms. Clearly, a lot had gone wrong.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">It is difficult for me to precisely identify the cause of the failure, but I can hypothesize some. Firstly, the resolution of the print may have been too high, so the diameter of the printed filament may have been too thin that there was an occasional gap in the print. Throughout the print, I can see that the filament was not printed in some places, and it was clearly visible on the base of the logo. The filament may not have been consistently pushed out, and the lack of filament in the organic support may have caused the support to be weak and fall. Also, since the filament is thin, the inner thickness of the organic tree may be too thin, that it was not able to support itself.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Secondly, I can hypothesize that the 'bottom contact Z distance' for support material is too high. TA Vincent recommended that the distance be 0.4mm, which is double the default value. The space between the plat part of the logo and the tree may have been too big that the support material could not cling to the floor well. Again, it is hard for me to precisely identify the cause of the failed print.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">14. Next Time</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">The goal of this project was not achieved. The Centurion Army cannot hold a credit card, or I need to tape it to the holder, which would not be ideal.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Regarding design optimization, I think everything is good except for the elliptical base. The oval that I created is not perfect. It is a bit too wide, so the distance between the edges of the oval and the logo is not constant. I should use a caliper or measuring tool in Fusion 360 to measure the distance and polish up the size of the oval.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">I want to print this again, but I think I have to approach the printing differently. I should print one part of the model at a time and calibrate it with the printer to find the optimal setting. After finding the ideal setting, I will use the Prusa Slicer to divide the print into four pieces: the base with the logo and leg, the right side of the army, the left side of the army, and the cardholder. I do not think it is best to print the entire model in one print, and it is better to divide up the print.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">More importantly, I need to change the print setting. I will lower the infill density to 30% because I do not think there is a good reason to keep it at 50%. I will address the oozing by decreasing the temperature from the default of 210°C to 200°C, increasing the retraction speed from the default of 70mm/s to 100mm/s, increasing the retraction length from the default of 3.2mm to 4.0mm, increasing the lift Z during retraction from the default of 0.2mm to 0.5mm, reduce the minimum travel after retraction from the default of 1.5mm to 0.1mm, and reduce the retract amount before wipe from the default of 70% to 80%. I will address the underexcretion by increasing the extrusion multiplier from the default of 1 to 1.05. Also, I watched a <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP2_Asz7xK8">video</a> for homework on the updated version of Prusa Slicer, and I learned that there are several techniques that I can utilize with the latest software. To make the logo look nicer, I will iron the logo. If I do end up wanting to print everything in one print, I will ‘paint’ where I want the enforcement of the supports and use the organic support, but I will test print certain parts that are difficult to print before I print everything.</p>
