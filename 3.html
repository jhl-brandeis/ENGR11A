I tried to get inspiration from something, and I started out with New York City, a place where I hope to reside. I thought of creating something artistic by using the Manhattan, the ship Benchy, and the figure of a businessman. Then, Professor Rogers approached me and advised me to fuse them together rather than just laying the pieces.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">1. Soldering Alarm Clock</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">This project began by soldering the alarm clock. The assembly kit had a circuit board, three displays, many resistors, four LED lights, and many more electrical components I was unfamiliar with. My partner and I have never soldered before, so we had much to learn quickly.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">The first problem was identifying the components and determining where they belong on the board. Some components are labeled with the code, and we identified them by referring to the instruction manual. However, many of the components were not labeled, and we had difficulty determining the direction of the components as the manual included unfamiliar jargon. So, we relied on some help from the instructors and TAs.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Once the components were identified, my partner and I took turns soldering, and since it was our first experience, we stumbled through the journey. We tried our best to mimic Professor Ian’s demonstration of soldering techniques, but we had difficulty controlling the flow and the size of the solder. The professors advised us to place the iron on the board and run the solder into it rather than trying to paint the solder, and this advice has helped us control the solder a lot more.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Nevertheless, we had to be careful not to let the applied solder cool down with the wire, as they would form a solid together, and the wire would attach to the board. So, we had to be wary of not letting the solder lie on the board too long.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Besides that, we also had to be cautious of not running too much solder on the board, as it would create a big sphere that would spill to their neighbors and merge them up. When such an incident occurs, we use a blue sucker that would satisfyingly suck the hot liquified solder and release it in solid. This was a useful skill that helped us undo the damage done.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">On the first day, we dipped our toes into the world of soldering and learned the fundamental skills.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">We had to create an enclosure that would house the alarm clock using the 3D printer, so we quickly measured the clock's width, length, and height. On the second day, we wanted to be mindful of the printing time. So, we decided to quickly make a simple enclosure in Fusion 360 and 3D print it.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">On Fusion 360, I applied many techniques, especially utilizing the feature Parameter, that I recently learned. After creating the 3D model, I sliced it using PrusaSlicer with a preset of “0.25mm DRAFT”. Before I printed it, I cleaned the plate with alcohol and ran a calibration on a printer but ran into a problem: the printer would not extrude any filament. With the help of the professors, we identified that there was rimming. While the TA was fixing the rimming, I tried to print with another printer, but that printer also had an issue of rimming. This time, I tried to fix it myself by unscrewing the tube connected to the motor and removing as much filament as I could from the machine. I was able to find the part of the filament that was rimming. After having confidence in identifying the cause of the problem, I placed the printer in ‘filament loading mode’ and tried to carefully push the filament through the motor. After some time, I was able to fix the rimming and start the 2.5 hours of print.</p>

Gladly, we fixed the issue and had a working alarm clock.</p>

We were confused because it was working well the other day. We tried to connect the new battery, but nothing was helping. Professor Ian diagnosed the issue and determined that the voltage was detected on the board, but somewhere in the circuit board, something went wrong. Even when the battery was attached to the system, the circuit board would not get warm, so we were all confused as to why it would not work overnight. With no clear idea of the cause of this issue, the only two options were to resolder the alarm clock and risk encountering the same issue or to move forward with the project.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">With the limited time given, we decided to devote our time to creating an enclosure by examining the fit of the 3D-printed enclosure. The print was successfully completed without a major issue. We tested the fit and realized that the sides of the circuit board were a little tight. Also, we realized that the enclosure was not perfectly printed, as there were some small dents sticking out. To remove the imperfection, we used a scraper with rough surfaces to scrape off the dents. After making the inner surface of the enclosure smooth, we reexamined the fit and determined that the tolerance should be increased by 0.10mm from 0.15mm to 0.25mm.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">We wanted to quickly know if the increase in tolerance was perfect, so we made a quick adjustment by simply changing the parameter ‘wiggleRoom’ and printing the top portion of the box. Rather than using Fusion 360 to remove the bottom portion of the box, I used PrusaSlicer and moved the box lower to remove the part that I did not wish to print. Since I was interested in finding the perfect tolerance for the width and the length of the alarm clock, a little bit needed to be printed, so only 33 minutes was needed.</p>

We carefully examined the fit and realized that one of the sides of the circuit board was not smooth and flat. At the top left corner of the board, there is a little dent that was causing the distance between the board and enclosure to be different across the edges. So, we decided to remove the dent by using the scraper with rough surfaces to sand it off.</p>

So, my partner went on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23853/makes">Thingiverse.com to find the perfect enclosure</a> , which he chose to be an igloo. He imported it into Fusion 360, and we created a shared group project in Fusion 360 with the help of TA. With my help, he learned how to turn the mesh into a body. Since the igloo has a lot of mesh, we had to wait for his computer to convert it into a body.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">11. Rethinking the Approach to Measurement</h2>
                            <p class="card-text">After some contemplation, I realized that there may be a flaw in the measurement method. For example, it may not have been the best to measure the distance between each electrical component. For the screen, we measured the distance between the edge of the board and the start of the screen, the distance between the start and the end of the screen, the end of the screen and the start of the next screen, and so on. When the individual measurement of the screen was added up, it did not add up to the actual width of the board. It is 0.50mm or 0.51% bigger.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">To address this issue, I remeasured all the dimensions by measuring the relative distance to a certain point of the circuit board, mainly the top left corner. So, when I would measure the location of the start of the second screen, I would measure the distance between the top left corner of the clock and the start of the second screen rather than adding up the measurements. A total of 59 measurements were done and entered as a parameter.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">I noticed that there are differences in the measurement between mine and the one taken with my partner. Finding all the differences would be simple, as we have measure different thing and to compare the distance between two points, I would have to do some more computation. Nevertheless, the most obvious differences are the width and the length of the circuit board. It was previously measured as 97.49mm by 48.92mm, but I found it to be 97.46mm by 48.90, which is 2mm to 3mm difference in measurement. This is a minor difference, but one of the most visible differences was the vertical distance between the edge of the board and the start of the screen. It was previously measured as 4.26mm, but I found it to be 3.5mm, which is 18% smaller. It seems that no two measurements between the previous one and the new one are the same, due to the nature of the caliper. The caliper measures the distance in 0.01mm increments, which is very small. And, it is also not easy to control the caliper, especially when external jaws – a tool used to measure the outer dimension of an object – are not used. Due to the smallness of the electrical components, we had to rely a lot on the depth measuring blade – a tool used to measure the depth of an object relative to the surface – and it was the hardest tool to control, because adjusting the force that we apply to slider the caliper is challenging and it is hard to make an adjustment in 0.01mm increment due to the friction between the slides.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Spending a few hours, I created a face and a simple rectangular enclosure with one fully constrained sketch. I made the distance between the circuit board and the enclosure 0.10mm and the distance between the face and the enclosure 0.10mm. I also added a hole for the 4 LED lights and the speaker. For all the holes, I extruded a tunnel between the face and the electrical components, because I did not want the green circuit board to be visible from the user’s perspective. Also, I created a simple rectangular button, that looks like a bar from the igloo, to help the user access the control on the alarm clock. To make the button not fall out, I created an offset on the inner side of the rectangular prism. I made the distance between the button and the face 0.10mm. Lastly, to ensure that the enclosure holds the circuit board firm and flat, I made the back of the enclosure open and created some stoppers around the back without obstructing the solder.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">After 2 hours of print, I examined the fit of the newly printed enclosure and the face with the circuit board. Surprisingly, the fit between the circuit board and the enclosure is different for two identical prints – red and blue. They are loose on red but tight on blue. Meanwhile, the fit between the face and the enclosure is tight for both prints. After some thought, I decreased the distance between the circuit board and the enclosure by 0.05mm from 0.10mm to 0.05mm and decreased the distance between the face and the enclosure by 0.08mm from 0.10mm to 0.18mm. Next, I noticed that the face was weak, because it is thin; so, I doubled the thickness from 1.5mm to 3.0mm. Also, due to the height of the tunnel between the face and the four red lights, the face cannot lie on top of the circuit board. The tunnel is too long and small. So, I was not able to examine the fit between the face and the board. To address this, I forcibly removed those four tunnels. After seeing the three objects combined, I had a better sense of idea on the way to improve the design of the face. The face looked too flat, so I added a fillet for all the holes except the button. I decreased the depth of the tunnel for the lights while increasing it for the screen, as a good portion of the green board was still visible. Also, the button was not functionable, because there was too much resistance between the face and the button due to the lack of space; so, I increased the distance between them by 0.17mm from 0.10mm to 0.27mm. Then, I thought that the size of the hole for the screen was too large. I no longer felt that the dimension of the hole should match the outline of the screen but should match the visible area of the screen. So, I decreased the size. Next, I added an enclosure for the wire so that the board is not visible from the side. After some many more minor adjustments, I printed them again for three hours.</p>

Firstly, the fit between the face and the enclosure was loose now, so I decreased the distance by 0.09 mm from 0.18mm to 0.09mm. Secondly, the depth of the tunnel for the four red lights was still long, so I decreased the depth by 4.0mm. Thirdly, the face was not held strongly, that the surface would wobble when the pressure was applied on the face. To strengthen the face, I created a support on the enclosure so that the face would not be pushed into the enclosure.</p>

Everything was perfect, except that the circuit board could not be placed in the enclosure, because there are the supports to prevent the face and circuit board from being pushed in too much. I failed to realize that the circuit board needed a way to get into the enclosure. Therefore, I removed the support for the face and placed the support on the face so that the face could not be pushed too far into the enclosure that it should be.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">While the new face was being printed, my partner was making a finishing touch on the igloo. After inserting the derive of the enclosure, he created a holder for the battery behind the circuit board. Then, he exported it into STL and sliced it in PrusaSlicer. However, the bottom half of the igloo was not visible. After consulting with Professor Ian, we tried a Windows-based software that fixes mesh, but it did not work out. Then, we tried using Netfabb, which is a built-in service in the Windows edition of PrusaSlicer, and gladly, it fixed the corrupted mesh. My partner printed the igloo, but on his first try, the filament wire got tangled up, causing the print to stop midway. So, he reattempted, and the outcome looked amazing.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Some of the aspects of the outcome that I wish were different were that the alarm clock turned on and the battery box thicker. We made the battery box only 2mm thick, and it has ripped from its weakness.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Regarding the process, I think all the steps that were taken were good. My partner and I divided up the work fairly equally. He took some time in soldering, making initial measurements, and taking care of the igloo, while I made the design of the face and ensured all the components fit perfectly.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Besides that, to recap some of the key mistakes, the way we approached the measurement was not ideal. When we are measuring the location of certain components on the circuit board, we should measure the distance relative to a certain fixed point. Another mistake was rushing through the CAD by failing to consider how the circuit board would be placed in the enclosure. Nevertheless, despite some hiccups in the process, I think it was a successful and fairly smooth process without a big headache.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Overall, this was a highly successful project. The igloo looks beautiful with multicolor filament. It is sturdy. The fit between the igloo, the face, and the circuit board is perfect.</p>
