                            <p class="card-text">For the Week 7 Project, I continued working on creating a modified version of e-NABLE Phoenix Hand v3 with my teammate and without a client. Our team divided up the work, and I took charge of addressing the weight imbalance in the patient's arms by adding some water tanks to the prosthesis device.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Despite a lot of phone calls and emails, we were unable to find a client willing and able to work with us. I was fairly confident that someone would know someone who needs a prosthesis device, but it seems that there are not that many people. According to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19165686/">NIH</a>, "Each year in the United States, an estimated 158,000 persons undergo amputationâ€¦" Since the US population is 331.9 million (United States Census Bureau), that is just under 0.05% who undergo amputation per year, so I can assume that it is rare. Hence, I came to a realization that despite the extensive networking opportunities available online, it is not that easy to find a person. Despite not having a client, our team has agreed to create an open-source prosthesis device.</p>

Our team felt that our client should be children because since they grow quickly, they cannot have an expensive prosthesis device and needs a temporary, cheaper one. After some contemplation within the team, I need statements is, "The children with an upper limb difference need a way to make various finger motions, so that they can hold and leverage objects."</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Based on the needs statement, our design principles, or the key features of our prototype, will need to be able to adjust individual finger motions and address the weight balance, as discussed in the previous project. So, the final product should have more options beyond having all five fingers either be flat or closed. At the same time, our team thinks that the hand should be heavy, so that the patient's right and left arms have the same balance. My teammate argued that having an imbalance is problematic for the patient's mental and physical well-being. Hence, the device should also have the capability to adjust its weight.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">One of my teammates is in charge of creating the finger that provides greater finger control to the user. Another teammate will modify the finger to allow it to install a tool to the fingertip. I will be in charge of addressing the weight balance. I have decided to base it on e-NABLE Phoenix Hand v3, as it is one of the most famous and reliable prosthesis devices. To add weight and have the capability to adjust weight, my team debated various options. Firstly, our team thought about changing the material of the hand, but I argued that that would have minimum impact. Secondly, our team talked about changing the density of the infill, and I argued that it would still have minimum impact on the weight, cost more to print, take more time to print, and be more environmentally unfriendly. Thirdly, our team talked about attaching heavy objects, such as magnets, but I argued that it would be difficult to securely install them, and the patient would need to have access to the same magnet as ours. Lastly, I argued that a water tank is the best option. I searched up which material has high density and found out that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density">water has relatively high-density</a>. I thought that using water is beneficial because it is widely accessible for a very low cost. For the design, I want to give the patient the flexibility on where they want to add the water tank and how much to add for each tank. I thought that the water tank should be detachable to give the patient flexibility and choice. I decided that there should be three places where the tank can be added: two on the arm and one on the hand. For the attachment and detachment system, I decided to use the system already present in the design. The water tank can be bigger or smaller, depending on how much weight is needed. Overall, the water tank will benefit the patient by preventing potential health issues arising from having unbalanced arms.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Our team has never used a different material from PLA (polylactic acid). We were introduced to PETG (polyethylene terephthalate glycol) and TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) by our TA. We got a chance to interact with them and found PETG to be similar to PLA and TPU to be very flexible. We were not sure how the e-NABLE Phoenix Hand v3 would look differently on those two different materials, so we printed the entire PhonizV3 on PETG and some parts on TPU. My team agreed to print them with 50% infill to have high density and focus on the right hand.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">The properties of TPU and PLA are noticeably different, and their difference is clear in person. TPU is very elastic, and when its shape is deformed, it will heal relatively quickly. Hence, even if I fold it in half, it will restore to its original shape without showing any mark of being deformed. Also, it is soft on the skin, so I found it friendly to the skin.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Therefore, my team decided that one of the parts of PhinexV3 should be printed in TPU: the arm guard. Besides the benefits stated above, the arm guard does not need to be heated up and bent. So, the patient or the builder of the prosthesis device does not have to use hot water or a dangerous heat gun to bend the arm guard. The tension from the Velcro is sufficient to deform the TPU and nicely and comfortably snug it on the arm.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">I created the CAD for the water tank using a lot of parameters in Fusion 360 so that I can easily change the dimensions of the water tank so that its capacity or weight can be changed quickly. To create a lid for the tank, I watched a <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-sqOc_O6is">YouTube tutorial</a>.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">To create an attachment system, I decided to simply use the same attachment system used in the PhinexV3 to connect the arm guard and string holder, because I was familiar with the design and knew that it worked well to hold them in place and to detach them. I downloaded the Fusion file from the open source and used the parts in the file. For example, to create a receiving end of the attachment system, I imported the arm guard to a new file and cut out unnecessary parts. To create a giving end of the attachment system, I similarly imported the string holder on a new file and cut out unnecessary parts. To add the receiving end of the attachment system on the arm guard and the hand, I linked the previous file and moved it to the appropriate location in 3D. Similarly, to add the giving end of the attachment system on the water tank, I linked the file that only contains the giving end and moved it to the appropriate location. In this way, if I need to make a modification to the attachment system, I can easily do so by only modifying the parent file and not the individually imported file.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">If I ever needed a prosthetic hand, I would want a customized version of a hand that is tailored to sculpturing, one of my favorite activities. For this art activity, several tools are needed: wire-end modeling, smooth modeling, carving, and detailing. These tools will be on each of the fingertips. Assuming that each hand can be controlled individually, such a prosthetic device can be beneficial when sculpturing because all the tools will be on their fingertip rather than having to drop off the tool, find the new one, and pick it up. This can save time. Also, having it on the fingertip could give greater control because it is built on the device and is sturdier and stable.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Since there is little difference between PLA and PETG, I printed the water tank on PLA. The difficult part is to print the tank without using a support inside the tank. Since the water tank is a rectangular prism, each side has a parallel side, so it cannot be printed without using a support. After some contemplation, I realized that I could rotate the model 45Â° from two axes, so that it could be printed like a diamond shape. In this way, the support can be printed outside the tank without printing any support inside the tank.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">After printing them out, I realized that the screw does not fit, the edges of the boxes are sharp, and the clip does not work. To address the screw, I increased the tolerance by 1mm. To address the sharp edges, I created a fillet of 3mm. Regarding the clip, I found out that there is a flaw in the Fusion file shared on the open-source website. On the receiving end of the attachment system, there should be a dent, and on the giving end, there should be a bump. However, on the Fusion file, there is a bump on the receiving end. Hence, the parts cannot be attached. Therefore, I had to remove the bump by creating a sphere with a negative volume. Gladly, since the children's files are linked to the parent file, changes made in the parent file were reflected on the arm guard and the hand.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">It is much better. The lid does not close smoothly initially. After some cleaning and some attempts, the lid does close all the way in. Nevertheless, I doubled the tolerance to 2mm. Regarding the water, the water tank holds the water well. However, a minor problem is that if I shake the tank, some water leaks out. I consulted with my professors, and they recommended that I use a rubber band to seal it. I placed a rubber band with a diameter of 5/16" on the lid, but it did not solve the problem. That is because the lid is not designed to hold a rubber band. The rubber band is not nicely held on the lid and is dropped into the dent of the thread. Hence, I created a place where the rubber band can sit.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Regarding the attachment system, it works now. The two pieces can hold together well and do not slip out. To remove them, they can be disconnected with some force. Hence, the attachment system is complete.</p>

Regarding the rubber band, it does not nicely sit in place and still drops into the dent of the thread. I intentionally made the height of the area where the rubber band would be located short to compensate for the shrinking height of the rubber band. However, it is too short. To fix this, I made it taller and placed it at a lower altitude, so that there was no risk of the rubber band falling into the dent of the threat. To save time, I did not print the entire water tank. Since I only made a modification on the lid, I only printed the lid.</p>

Hence, no matter how much I shake it, the water would not leak. Therefore, I think I have finished creating a water tank. It works as intended, its capacity can be modified easily, and it can be attached and detached simply.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">In this project, PLA, PETG, and TPG were explored. Changes from PLA or PETG to TPG made the biggest difference. PETG is so similar to PLA that I feel no need to distinguish the use case between them: they are both durable, solid, and difficult to break without great force. However, TPG is very different from other materials: it is flexible to the point that it is difficult to be broken apart with great force. Nevertheless, all the materials have similar densities, so choosing one material over another for weight reasons is not appropriate.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">After 2 hours of print, I examined the fit of the newly printed enclosure and the face with the circuit board. Surprisingly, the fit between the circuit board and the enclosure is different for two identical prints â€“ red and blue. They are loose on red but tight on blue. Meanwhile, the fit between the face and the enclosure is tight for both prints. After some thought, I decreased the distance between the circuit board and the enclosure by 0.05mm from 0.10mm to 0.05mm and decreased the distance between the face and the enclosure by 0.08mm from 0.10mm to 0.18mm. Next, I noticed that the face was weak, because it is thin; so, I doubled the thickness from 1.5mm to 3.0mm. Also, due to the height of the tunnel between the face and the four red lights, the face cannot lie on top of the circuit board. The tunnel is too long and small. So, I was not able to examine the fit between the face and the board. To address this, I forcibly removed those four tunnels. After seeing the three objects combined, I had a better sense of idea on the way to improve the design of the face. The face looked too flat, so I added a fillet for all the holes except the button. I decreased the depth of the tunnel for the lights while increasing it for the screen, as a good portion of the green board was still visible. Also, the button was not functionable, because there was too much resistance between the face and the button due to the lack of space; so, I increased the distance between them by 0.17mm from 0.10mm to 0.27mm. Then, I thought that the size of the hole for the screen was too large. I no longer felt that the dimension of the hole should match the outline of the screen but should match the visible area of the screen. So, I decreased the size. Next, I added an enclosure for the wire so that the board is not visible from the side. After some many more minor adjustments, I printed them again for three hours.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">The fit was a lot better overall. Only three minor adjustments were needed. Firstly, the fit between the face and the enclosure was loose now, so I decreased the distance by 0.09 mm from 0.18mm to 0.09mm. Secondly, the depth of the tunnel for the four red lights was still long, so I decreased the depth by 4.0mm. Thirdly, the face was not held strongly, that the surface would wobble when the pressure was applied on the face. To strengthen the face, I created a support on the enclosure so that the face would not be pushed into the enclosure.</p>

Everything was perfect, except that the circuit board could not be placed in the enclosure, because there are the supports to prevent the face and circuit board from being pushed in too much. I failed to realize that the circuit board needed a way to get into the enclosure. Therefore, I removed the support for the face and placed the support on the face so that the face could not be pushed too far into the enclosure that it should be.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">While the new face was being printed, my partner was making a finishing touch on the igloo. After inserting the derive of the enclosure, he created a holder for the battery behind the circuit board. Then, he exported it into STL and sliced it in PrusaSlicer. However, the bottom half of the igloo was not visible. After consulting with Professor Ian, we tried a Windows-based software that fixes mesh, but it did not work out. Then, we tried using Netfabb, which is a built-in service in the Windows edition of PrusaSlicer, and gladly, it fixed the corrupted mesh. My partner printed the igloo, but on his first try, the filament wire got tangled up, causing the print to stop midway. So, he reattempted, and the outcome looked amazing.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Some of the aspects of the outcome that I wish were different were that the alarm clock turned on and the battery box thicker. We made the battery box only 2mm thick, and it has ripped from its weakness.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Regarding the process, I think all the steps that were taken were good. My partner and I divided up the work fairly equally. He took some time in soldering, making initial measurements, and taking care of the igloo, while I made the design of the face and ensured all the components fit perfectly.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Besides that, to recap some of the key mistakes, the way we approached the measurement was not ideal. When we are measuring the location of certain components on the circuit board, we should measure the distance relative to a certain fixed point. Another mistake was rushing through the CAD by failing to consider how the circuit board would be placed in the enclosure. Nevertheless, despite some hiccups in the process, I think it was a successful and fairly smooth process without a big headache.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Overall, this was a highly successful project. The igloo looks beautiful with multicolor filament. It is sturdy. The fit between the igloo, the face, and the circuit board is perfect.</p>
